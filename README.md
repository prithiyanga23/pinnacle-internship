# pinnacle-internship

As a Web Development Intern at Pinnacle Labs, I am gaining hands-on experience in building responsive and interactive websites using modern frontend technologies. This internship allows me to work on real-world projects, collaborate with developers, and enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like Tailwind CSS.
